Hackathon Use Case: Information Extraction from f D F
Scanned User-Filled Forms

1. Problem Statement

Organizations across domains such as banking, travel, and employment rely heavily on
user-filled forms for onboarding and operational workflows. These forms are often scanned
images or photos submitted by users, making automated processing challenging due to
handwritten text, varying layouts, inconsistent structures, 5, and noise. Manual data entry is
slow, error-prone, and costly. —

This use case focuses on building an Information Extraction System that can
automatically extract structured data from scanned application forms (e.g., banking
applications, travel agency forms, or employment forms), enabling faster processing a and
integration with downstream systems.

2. Objective
Build an end-to-end GenAl-powered system capable of:—~

e Reading scanned or uploaded user-filled fornrs~

e Extracting key information (textual fields, checkboxes, signatures, tables, IDs)

e Validating and normalizing the extracted data®

e Returning structured output (JSON or form-specific schema) *

e Supporting plug-and-play extraction for multiple form types ¢

© Self service portal with user interface that can provided to end users and it should
have the capability to generate user based report. —

3. Scope of the Solution
The solution will:

e Accept input as scanned image/PDF

¢ Perform OCR + intelligent layout detection ~

e Use LLM-based or rule-based extraction to populate structured output—~
e Consider any one form categories of your choice; —

° Banking.application form, Travel booking/visa form, Employment/HR
onboarding form
